##Ideas for v4.0

After a long plan, we've decided to release the script with 

* Full automated UCS restater/Stoper/Starter in web interface (admin process)
* Online, live DATABASE editing tools (Admin process)
* Account specailly for ADMIN (only person to use admin process)
* Automatic UCS and Script updated
* CSV files editing and updating in web interface (might be introduced in 5.0)
* Automatic patcher and uploader to our global secure server
* And more....

I you are willing to make any changes please make a pull request or

Code with me in CLOUD at [cloud9]{https://ide.c9.io/karansanjeev/smartstats)

If you have any other problem, suggestion, please make a issue for that and be as discriptive as possible but be narrow also!

Cheers,
